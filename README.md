## What it is

A browser-based console for the RoastSee NEXT. It talks to the instrument over Web Bluetooth or Web Serial,
draws Agtron, stable Agtron, Agtron ROR and audio level as live roast curves, marks Yellow / First Crack /
Second Crack / Drop as vertical lines, and exports a whole roast as CSV / JSON / ZIP.

No backend, no installer, no build step: **all of the code lives in a single HTML file**, so edit-and-refresh is the whole workflow.

## Features

- **Two links at once**: Bluetooth BLE (Notify) and UART0 serial can be used separately or together; both feed one unified event table.
- **Roast curves**
  - Four series: current Agtron, stable Agtron, Agtron ROR and audio level.
  - Yellow / First Crack / Second Crack / Drop are drawn automatically as vertical markers.
  - Wheel to zoom, drag to pan, double-click to reset, and **hover to read values** (the four readings at the point under the cursor).
  - Ranges and steps are configurable: time / Agtron / ROR limits and tick steps; leave a field empty for auto.
    The auto range only counts valid readings, so the placeholder 0 the device sends while idle is ignored.
  - One-click fullscreen for the chart (`Esc` or the same button to exit).
- **Export**
  - Live data: CSV / TSV / JSON, one row per uploaded frame (current Agtron, stable Agtron, ROR, audio level, distance, yellow-point time/flag, device record number). This is the one to use for curve analysis.
  - Curve images: PNG / JPEG / WebP.
  - Curve data: CSV / TSV are plain numeric tables (header + values) that MATLAB, pandas, Origin, Excel and gnuplot read directly; JSON also carries the marker data.
  - Packet list: CSV / JSON / ZIP (the ZIP holds `packets.csv`, `packets.json` and a short readme, ready to forward).
  - Event table: CSV, with second / 0.1 s / millisecond time precision.
- **Bilingual UI**: one-click switch in the top right, or open with `?lang=en`.
- **Accessibility**: visible focus rings while tabbing; validation messages appear next to the field instead of in dialogs.
- **Built-in simulator**: with no instrument at hand, "start live simulation" runs the same parsing path so you can preview curves and exports.

## Quick start

Pick whichever of the three suits you; they are equivalent.

### 1. Just double-click

Download the repo and double-click `next_upper_computer.html`. Modern Chrome treats local files as a secure
context, so both Web Bluetooth and Web Serial work (verified here on Chrome 154: `navigator.bluetooth.getAvailability()`
returns `true` and `navigator.serial.getPorts()` returns an array).

> The trade-off: permission for a local file cannot be remembered per origin, so you re-pick the device or serial port on every connect.

### 2. Local server (recommended for daily use)

Double-click `START_HTML_SERVER.cmd` on Windows, or `START_HTML_SERVER.command` on macOS (right-click → Open the
first time). It finds a local Python, serves `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and opens the page (if the port is taken it
walks forward). The `_EN` variant opens straight into the English UI. To stop it, close the minimised
`RoastSee NEXT Server` window (Windows) or the Terminal window (macOS).

### 3. Static hosting (like a normal website)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lebrew-tech/RoastSee-NEXT-Console.git
```

The whole repo is static files, so any static host works: GitHub Pages, object storage (OSS / COS), your own site.

To turn on GitHub Pages: **Settings → Pages → Source**, pick branch `main` and `/ (root)`, then open:

```text
https://lebrew-tech.github.io/RoastSee-NEXT-Console/
https://lebrew-tech.github.io/RoastSee-NEXT-Console/?lang=en
```

> Note: `github.io` is unreliable from mainland China. For production use, prefer your own domain or domestic object storage. **The repo must be public for free Pages.**

## Browser requirements

- Desktop **Chrome / Edge** on Windows or macOS. Safari implements neither API; Firefox has Web Serial (151+) but no Web Bluetooth.
- The page must run in a secure context: `file://`, `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://localhost` and `https://` all work;
  a plain-`http://` LAN address (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x`) does not.
- The first connection needs a manual grant in the browser's device or port picker.

> **macOS serial note**: the device uses a **CH340** USB-to-serial chip, which macOS does not drive out of the box.
> If the port never shows up, install WCH's `CH34xVCPDriver` (then open the `CH34xVCPDriver` app from Launchpad,
> click Install once, and replug the device). **Bluetooth needs no driver at all.**

## Hardware

RoastSee NEXT is LeBrew's roast analyser; it captures Agtron and audio data, and this console turns that data into curves you can read.

## Development and tests

The tests need no browser: the relevant modules are lifted out of the HTML and run in Node, fully offline.

```bash
node tests/curve_module_test.mjs   # curves: recording, dedup, markers, full draw path (38 checks)
node tests/serial_route_test.mjs   # serial byte routing: AA55 frames never swallow plain text (8 checks)
node tests/contrast_scan.mjs       # colour contrast against WCAG AA (26 pairs)
```

The first two are functional regressions, the third guards visual readability.

## Protocol

Everything needed to talk to the NEXT is in this repo; skip this if you only want to use the app:

- BLE service UUID `000000BB-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`, characteristic UUID `0000BB01-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB` (Notify).
- The `NEXT:` text command table: page control, start / stop roast, Agtron measurement, history read, yellow-point threshold, and more.
- The UART0 live frame layout (header `AA55`) and its parsing logic.

## Known issues

- **A gap at the start of the curve.** The curve's X axis is the instrument's own roast stopwatch (it starts counting when
  you press Start on the machine), and the console only draws live frames received *after* connecting - it does not
  back-fill earlier data. Press Start first and then connect, reload the page mid-roast, or hit the curve reset, and that
  opening stretch stays empty. To record a full roast, connect the console first and then press Start.
- **The raw log keeps only the last 200 lines.** With firmware 1.1.7 the instrument emits about 20 extra raw-data lines per
  second while measuring (`LZRAW` / `AGRAW`). Appending every one of them to the log froze the page after roughly a minute,
  so the log is now length-capped, raw-data lines are not shown, and serial / BLE receive activity is summarised once per
  second. For frame-by-frame detail use the `NEXT packets` tab. Verified against a continuous 15-minute recording.
## Acknowledgements

Curve presentation in this console takes its cues from **Artisan**, the open-source roast-logging software by
**Marko Luther** and contributors - [artisan-scope.org](https://artisan-scope.org/) and
[artisan-roaster-scope/artisan](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan) (AGPL-3.0). It inspired the layout
and the interaction only; **no Artisan code is used in this project**, so the two codebases stay licence-independent.
